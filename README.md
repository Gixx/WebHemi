# WebHemi

The **WebHemi**, as a standalone project is now become deprecated. The base idea was nice and noble, but the time and technology ruthlessly passed on the *Hype*way.

For the original development source files as well as the changelog and resources please check the [Latest Release](https://github.com/Gixx/WebHemi/releases/latest). 

# So what will be in this repository?

My plan is split the original WebHemi services into their own managed repositories (both backend and frontend), and here I will only put references to them.
