Introduction
------------

After many years of [endless development of a big, robust, super-universal blog engine](https://github.com/Gixx/WebHemi-legacy-v2)
which was suppose to build on a well known framework, I decided to re-think my goals and the way I want to reach them.
With the very helpful guidance of the [owner](https://github.com/janoszen) of the [refaktormagazin/blog](https://github.com/refaktormagazin/blog)
repository, now I try to create a small, fast and 'only as much as necessary', clean-code blog engine.

**BE AWARE! THIS IS ONLY AN EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT WITH LIMITED TIME, RESOURCE AND SUPPORT CAPABILITIES.**

Use it at your own will.

BEHIND THE SCENES
-----------------

The WebHemi is a simple blog engine that tries to completely apply the S.O.L.I.D. principles, uses the PSR-7 HTTP Messages Interfaces and the Middleware concept.
