Introduction
------------

After many years of [endless development of a big, robust, super-universal blog engine](https://github.com/Gixx/WebHemi-legacy-v2) 
which was suppose to build on a well known framework, I decided to re-think my goals and the way I want to reach them. 
With the very helpful guidance of the [owner](https://github.com/janoszen) of the [refaktormagazin/blog](https://github.com/refaktormagazin/blog) 
repository, now I try to create a small, fast and 'only as much as necessary', clean-code blog engine.
